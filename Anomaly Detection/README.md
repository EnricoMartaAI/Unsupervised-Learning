This lab sessions focuse on identifying anomalies using proximity-based approaches and comparing the effectiveness of these methods against reconstruction-based techniques, 
such as Principal Component Analysis (PCA). 
The goal is to understand how proximity measures can be used to detect outliers and evaluate their performance relative to methods that rely on reconstructing the 
underlying data structure.
